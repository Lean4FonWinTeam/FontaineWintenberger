The first three sections serves for the tilting equivalence. The remaining parts serves for the concrete example of cyclotomic fields.

\section{Perfectoid Fields}

    Let $K$ be a topological field. We say that $K$ is a \emph{perfectoid field} if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\\
    (a) the topology on K is induced by a valuation $\| \cdot \| : K â†’ \R _{\ge0}$, and $K$ is complete for this topology;\\
    (b) there exists a non-unit $\pi \in \O_K$ such that $p \in \pi^p \O_K$;\\
    (c) every element of $\O_K/p\O_K$ is a $p$th-power.
\end{definition}
