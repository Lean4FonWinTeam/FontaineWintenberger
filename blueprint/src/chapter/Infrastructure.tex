\section{Missing Infrastructures in Mathlib}
In this section, we record the missing infrastructures in a rough way. All definitions and theorem under a same topic will be bundled in a single definition.

\begin{definition}
    \label{Relate Galois Group with Category of Finite Field Extensions}
    \notready

    Inteperate Galois group as functors on $ \text{FinExt}_K $ satisfying certain property. Show that $\text{FinExt}_K \simeq \text{FinExt}_K'$ induces an isomorphism $\Gal_K \simeq \Gal_{K'}$.
\end{definition}
